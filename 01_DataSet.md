This app will demonstrate simple, additive and interactive regression. It will use the dataset Salaries, (from Fox J. and Weisberg, S. (2011) An R Companion to Applied Regression, Second Edition Sage).

The data set contains 397 observations on the following 6 variables:

Variable Name          | Description
