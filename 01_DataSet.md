This app will demonstrate simple, additive and interactive regression. It will use the dataset Salaries, (from Fox J. and Weisberg, S. (2011) An R Companion to Applied Regression, Second Edition Sage).

The data set contains 397 observations containing 7 variables, shown further below. 

The data investigates whether there is a correlation between various explanatory variables and a professor's salary. We will investigate this while demonstrating various methods of regression.
